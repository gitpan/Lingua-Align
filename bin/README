Here are some example scripts showing how to use Lingua::Align
Some are ready to use as front-ends for tree alignment and alignment
evaluation. Look especially at

treealign (there is POD information included)
treealigneval (for evaluation)

Example alignments can be run with 
Smultron data (see ../examples/smultron/)
Europarl data (see ../examples/europarl) and
WPT 2003 data (see ../examples/wpt03)



megam

Lingua::Align uses external tools for training the local
classifiers. Currently it uses megam, a state-of-the-art
implementation of a maximum-entropy based classifier. We include the
binary version of megam (compiled on a standard i688 Linux
architecture) in this package which can be downloaded from
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~hal/megam/ We are not aware of any copyright
restrictions. Please contact the author in any cases of doubt about
licenses etc. For further details look at http://www.cs.utah.edu/~hal/
