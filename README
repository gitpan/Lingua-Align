=====================================================


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DOCUMENTATION

Look at the files in doc/
To run on some small sample data: look at examples/europarl/
and run "make test" (look into the Makefile for more information)

Other tests can be run on Smultron data (in examples/smultron/)
Download the treebank from http://kitt.cl.uzh.ch/kitt/smultron/

Using Lingua::Align for word alignment is demonstrated in examples/wpt03


ATTENTION:

- The aligner uses "megam" as the base classifier which is
  provided as a pre-compiles binary in bin/megam for i686 Linux platforms!

- For Mac-OS X (10.4 or higher):
  Replace bin/megam with bin/megam.osx

- For other platforms:
  You need to dowload the source code of megam and compile it for your
  system! The source code (and documentation) is here:
