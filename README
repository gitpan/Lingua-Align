ATTENTION:

- The aligner uses "megam" as the base classifier which is
  provided as a pre-compiles binary in bin/megam for i686 Linux platforms!

- For Mac-OS X (10.4 or higher):
  Replace bin/megam with bin/megam.osx

- For other platforms:
  You need to dowload the source code of megam and compile it for your
  system! The source code (and documentation) is here:
