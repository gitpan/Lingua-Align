the garden of eden
... at some point something must have come from nothing ...
sophie amundsen was on her way home from school .
she had walked the first part of the way with joanna .
they had been discussing robots .
joanna thought -- the human brain was like an advanced computer .
sophie was not certain -- she agreed .
surely a person was more than a piece of hardware ?
when they got to the supermarket -- they went their separate ways .
sophie lived on the outskirts of a sprawling suburb and had almost twice as far to school as joanna .
there were no other houses beyond her garden , which -- made it seem as if her house lay at the end of the world .
this was where the woods began -- .
she turned the corner into clover close .
at the end of the road there was a sharp bend , known -- as captain ’s bend .
people seldom went that way -- except on the weekend -- .
it was early may .
the birches were already in pale green leaf .
it -- was extraordinary how everything burst forth at this time of year !
what -- made this great mass of green vegetation come -- welling up from the dead earth as soon as it got warm and the last traces of snow disappeared ?
as sophie opened her garden gate , she looked in the mailbox .
from time to time there would be a few letters from the bank for her father , but then he was not a normal father .
sophie ’s father was the captain of a big oil tanker , and was away for most of the year .
during the few weeks at a time when he was at home -- , he would shuffle around the house -- making it nice and cosy for sophie and her mother .
but when he was at sea -- he could seem very distant .
there was only one letter in the mailbox and it was for sophie . .
the white envelope read : " sophie amundsen , 3 clover close . "
that was all ; it did not say who it was from -- .
as soon as sophie had closed the gate behind her she opened the envelope .
it contained only a slip of paper no bigger than the envelope .
it read : who -- are you ?
nothing else , only the three words , written -- by hand , and followed -- by a large question mark .
she looked at the envelope again .
the letter was definitely for her .
who -- could have dropped it in the mailbox ?
sophie let herself quickly into the red house .
as always , her cat sherekan managed -- to slink out of the bushes , jump onto the front step , and slip in through the door before she closed it behind her .
whenever sophie ’s mother was in a bad mood -- , she would call the house -- they lived in -- a menagerie .
a menagerie was a collection of animals .
it had begun with the three goldfish , goldtop , red ridinghood , and black jack .
next she got two budgerigars called -- smitt and smule , then govinda the tortoise , and finally the marmalade cat sherekan .
they had all been given -- to her -- to make up for the fact that her mother never got home from work until late in the afternoon and her father was away so much , -- sailing all over the world .
sophie slung her schoolbag on the floor and put a bowl of cat food out for sherekan .
then she sat down on a kitchen stool with the mysterious letter in her hand .
who -- are you ?
she had no idea .
she was sophie amundsen , of course , but who -- was that ?
she had not really figured that out yet .
what if she had been given a different name ?
anne knutsen , for instance .
would she then have been someone else ?
she suddenly remembered that dad had originally wanted her to be called -- lillemor .
sophie tried -- to imagine herself -- shaking hands and introducing herself as lillemor amundsen , but it seemed all wrong .
it -- was someone else who -- kept -- introducing herself .
she jumped up and went into the bathroom with the strange letter in her hand .
she stood in front of the mirror and stared into her own eyes .
" i am sophie amundsen , " she said -- .
the girl in the mirror did not react with as much as a twitch .
whatever sophie did -- , she did exactly the same .
sophie tried -- to beat her reflection to it with a lightning movement but the other girl was just as fast .
" who -- are you ? " sophie asked -- .
she received no response to this either , but felt a momentary confusion as to whether it was she or her reflection who -- had asked the question .
sophie pressed her index finger to the nose in the mirror and said , " you are me . "
as she got no answer to this , she turned the sentence around and said , " i am you . "
sophie amundsen was often dissatisfied -- with her appearance .
she was frequently told -- that she had beautiful almond-shaped eyes , but that was probably just something -- people said because her nose was too small and her mouth was a bit too big .
and her ears were much too close to her eyes .
worst of all was her straight hair , which it -- was impossible -- to do anything with -- .
sometimes her father would stroke her hair and call her " the girl with the flaxen hair , " after a piece of music by claude debussy .
it was all right for him , he was not condemned to -- living with this straight dark hair .
sometimes she thought -- she was so ugly that she wondered if she was malformed -- at birth .
her mother always went on about her difficult labor .
but was that really what -- determined how you looked -- ?
was n’t it -- odd that she did n’t know who she was -- ?
and was n’t it -- unreasonable that she had n’t been allowed -- to have any say in what she would look like -- ?
her looks had just been dumped -- on her .
she could choose her own friends , but she certainly had n’t chosen herself .
she had not even chosen -- to be a human being .
what -- was a human being ?
sophie looked up at the girl in the mirror again .
" i think -- i ’ll go upstairs and do my biology homework , " she said -- , almost apologetically .
once she was out in the hall , she thought , no , i ’d rather go out in the garden .
" kitty , kitty , kitty ! "
sophie chased the cat out onto the doorstep and closed the front door behind her .
as she stood outside on the gravel path with the mysterious letter in her hand , the strangest feeling came over her .
she felt like a doll that -- had suddenly been brought to life -- by the wave of a magic wand .
was n’t it -- extraordinary -- to be in the world right now , -- wandering around in a wonderful adventure !
sherekan sprang lightly across the gravel and slid into a dense clump of red-currant bushes .
a live cat , vibrant with energy from its white whiskers to the twitching tail at the end of its sleek body .
it was here in the garden too , but -- hardly aware of it in the same way as sophie .
as sophie started -- to think about -- being alive , she began -- to realize that she would not be alive forever .
i am in the world now , she thought -- , but one day i shall be gone .
was there a life after death ?
this was another question -- the cat was blissfully unaware of -- .
it -- was not long since sophie ’s grandmother had died .
for more than six months sophie had missed her every single day .
how unfair ---- that life had -- to end !
sophie stood on the gravel path , -- thinking .
she tried -- to think extra hard about -- being alive so as -- to forget that she would not be alive forever .
but it was impossible .
as soon as she concentrated on -- being alive now , the thought of dying also came into her mind .
the same thing happened the other way around : only by -- conjuring up an intense feeling of one day -- being dead could she appreciate how terribly good it was -- to be alive .
it was like two sides of a coin that she kept -- turning -- over and over .
and the bigger and clearer one side of the coin became -- , the bigger and clearer the other side became -- too .
you can ’t experience -- being alive without -- realizing that you have -- to die , she thought -- .
but it -- ’s just as impossible -- to realize -- you have -- to die without -- thinking how incredibly amazing it -- is -- -- to be alive .
sophie remembered granny saying something like that the day the doctor told her -- she was ill .
how tragic that most people had -- to get ill before they understood what a gift it -- was -- -- to be alive .
or else they had -- to find a mysterious letter in the mailbox !
perhaps she should go and see if any more letters had arrived .
sophie hurried to the gate and looked inside the green mailbox .
she was startled -- to find that it contained another white envelope , exactly like the first .
but the mailbox had definitely been empty when she took the first envelope -- !
this envelope had her name on it as well .
she tore it open and fished out a note the same size as the first one .
where does the world come from -- ? it said -- .
i do n’t know , sophie thought -- .
surely nobody really knows .
and yet sophie thought -- it was a fair question .
for the first time in her life she felt -- it -- was n’t right -- to live in the world without at least -- inquiring where it came from -- .
the mysterious letters had made sophie ’s head spin .
it was where she went -- when she was terribly angry , terribly miserable , or terribly happy -- .
today she was simply confused -- .
the red house was surrounded -- by a large garden with lots of flowerbeds , fruit bushes , fruit trees of different kinds , a spacious lawn with a glider and a little gazebo that granddad had built -- for granny when she lost their first child a few weeks after it was born -- -- .
the child ’s name was marie .
on her gravestone were the words : " little marie to us came , greeted us and left again . "
down in a corner of the garden behind all the raspberry bushes was a dense thicket where neither flowers nor berries would grow -- .
actually , it was an old hedge that -- had once marked the boundary to the woods , but because nobody had trimmed it for the last twenty years it had grown into a tangled and impenetrable mass .
granny used -- to say -- the hedge made it harder for the foxes to take the chickens during the war , when the chickens had free range of the garden -- .
to everyone but sophie , the old hedge was just as useless as the rabbit hutches at the other end of the garden .
but that was only because they had n’t discovered sophie ’s secret .
sophie had known about the little hole in the hedge for as long as she could remember .
when she crawled through it -- she came into a large cavity between the bushes .
it was like a little house .
she knew -- nobody would find her there .
-- clutching the two envelopes in her hand , sophie ran through the garden , crouched down on all fours , and wormed her way through the hedge .
the den was almost high enough for her to stand upright , but today she sat down on a clump of gnarled roots .
from there she could look out through tiny peepholes between the twigs and leaves .
although none of the holes was bigger than a small coin , she had a good view of the whole garden .
when she was little -- she used -- to think -- it -- was fun -- to watch her mother and father searching for her among the trees .
sophie had always thought -- the garden was a world of its own .
each time she heard about the garden of eden in the bible it reminded her of -- sitting here in the den , -- surveying her own little paradise .
where does the world come from -- ?
she had n’t the faintest idea .
sophie knew that the world was only a small planet in space .
but where did space come from -- ?
it -- was possible that space had always existed , in which case she would not also need -- to figure out where it came from -- .
but could anything have always existed ?
something deep down inside her protested at the idea .
surely everything that -- exists must have had a beginning ?
so space must sometime have been created -- out of something else .
but if space had come from something else , then that something else must also have come from something .
sophie felt -- she was only deferring the problem .
at some point , something must have come from nothing .
but was that possible ?
was n’t that just as impossible as the idea that the world had always existed ?
they had learned at school that god created the world .
but then she started -- to think again .
she could accept that god had created space , but what about god himself ?
had he created himself out of nothing ?
again there was something deep down inside her that -- protested .
even though god could create all kinds of things , he could hardly create himself before he had a " self " to create with -- .
so there was only one possibility left : god had always existed .
but she had already rejected that possibility !
everything that -- existed had -- to have a beginning .
oh , drat !
she opened the two envelopes again .
who -- are you ?
where does the world come from -- ?
what annoying questions !
and anyway where did the letters come from -- ?
that was just as mysterious , almost .
who -- had jolted sophie out of her everyday existence and suddenly brought her face to face with the great riddles of the universe ?
for the third time sophie went to the mailbox .
the mailman had just delivered the day ’s mail .
sophie fished out a bulky pile of junk mail , periodicals , and a couple of letters for her mother .
there was also a postcard of a tropical beach .
she turned the card over .
it had a norwegian stamp on it and was postmarked " un batalion . "
could it be from dad ?
but was n’t he in a completely different place ?
it was n’t his handwriting either .
sophie felt her pulse quicken a little as she saw who the postcard was addressed to -- : " hilde møller knag , c/o sophie amundsen , 3 clover close ... "
the rest of the address was correct .
the card read :
dear hilde , happy 15th birthday !
as i ’m sure -- you ’ll understand , i want -- to give you a present that -- will help you grow .
-- forgive me for -- sending the card c/o sophie .
love from dad .
sophie raced back to the house and into the kitchen .
her mind was in a turmoil .
who -- was this " hilde , " whose fifteenth birthday -- was just a month before her own ?
sophie got out the telephone book .
there were a lot of people called -- møller , and quite a few called -- knag .
she examined the mysterious card again .
it certainly seemed genuine enough ; it had a stamp and a postmark .
why would a father send a birthday card to sophie ’s address -- when it was quite obviously intended -- to go somewhere else -- ?
what kind of father -- would cheat his own daughter of a birthday card by -- purposely sending it astray ?
how could it be " the easiest way " ?
and above all , how was she supposed -- to trace this hilde person ?
so now sophie had another problem to worry about -- .
she tried -- to get her thoughts in order :
this afternoon , in the space of two short hours , she had been presented -- with three problems .
the first problem was who -- had put the two white envelopes in her mailbox .
the second was the difficult questions -- these letters contained .
the third problem was who hilde møller knag could be -- , and why sophie had been sent -- her birthday card -- .
she was sure that the three problems were interconnected -- in some way .
the top hat
... the only thing -- we require -- to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder ...
sophie was sure -- she would hear from the anonymous letter writer again .
she decided -- not to tell anyone about the letters for the time being .
at school she had trouble -- concentrating on what the teachers said -- .
they seemed -- to talk only about unimportant things .
why could n’t they talk about what a human being is -- or about what the world is -- and how it came into being -- -- ?
for the first time she began -- to feel that at school as well as everywhere else people were only concerned -- with trivialities .
there were major problems that -- needed -- to be solved -- .
did anybody have answers to these questions ?
sophie felt that thinking about them was more important than memorizing irregular verbs .
when the bell rang after the last class -- , she left the school so fast that joanna had -- to run -- to catch up with her .
after a while joanna said , " do you want -- to play cards this evening ? "
sophie shrugged her shoulders .
" i ’m not that interested in card games any more . "
joanna looked surprised .
-- let ’s play badminton then . "
sophie stared down at the pavement -- then up at her friend .
" i do n’t think -- i ’m that interested in badminton either . "
sophie noticed the touch of bitterness in joanna ’s tone .
" do you mind -- telling me what -- ’s suddenly so important ? "
sophie just shook her head .
" it ’s ... it ’s a secret . "
you ’re probably in love ! "
the two girls walked on for a while without -- saying anything .
when they got to the soccer field -- joanna said , " i ’m going across the field . "
across the field !
sophie regretted -- having been mean to her .
but what else could she have said -- ?
that she had suddenly become so engrossed in who she was -- and where the world came from -- that she had no time -- to play badminton ?
would joanna have understood ?
why was it -- so difficult -- to be absorbed in the most vital and , in a way the most natural of all questions -- ?
she felt her heart beating faster as she opened the mailbox .
at first she found only a letter from the bank and some big brown envelopes for her mother .
darn !
sophie had been looking forward to -- getting another letter from the unknown sender .
as she closed the gate behind her she noticed her own name on one of the big envelopes .
-- turning it over , she saw -- written on the back : " course in philosophy .
-- handle with care . "
sophie ran up the gravel path and flung her schoolbag onto the step .
-- stuffing the other letters under the doormat , she ran around into the back garden and sought refuge in the den .
this was the only place -- -- to open the big letter .
sherekan came -- jumping after her but sophie had -- to put up with that .
she knew -- the cat would not give her away .
inside the envelope there were three typewritten pages held -- together with a paper clip .
sophie began -- to read .
what -- is philosophy
dear sophie ,
lots of people have hobbies .
some people collect old coins or foreign stamps , some do needlework , others spend most of their spare time on a particular sport .
a lot of people enjoy -- reading .
but reading tastes differ widely .
some people only read newspapers or comics , some like -- reading novels while others prefer books on astronomy , wildlife , or technological discoveries .
if i happen -- to be interested in horses or precious stones , i cannot expect everyone else to share my enthusiasm .
if i watch all the sports programs on tv with great pleasure , i must put up with the fact that other people find sports boring .
is there nothing that -- interests us all ?
is there nothing that -- concerns everyone no matter who they are -- or where they live in the world -- ?
yes , dear sophie , there are questions that -- certainly should interest everyone .
they are precisely the questions -- this course is about -- .
what -- is the most important thing in life ?
if we ask someone living on the edge of starvation , the answer is food .
if we ask someone dying of cold , the answer is warmth .
if we put the same question to someone who -- feels lonely and isolated , the answer will probably be the company of other people .
but when these basic needs have been satisfied -- will there still be something that everybody needs ?
philosophers think so .
they believe that man can not live by bread alone .
of course everyone needs food .
and everyone needs love and care .
but there is something else -- apart from that -- which everyone needs and that -- is -- to figure out who we are -- and why we are here -- .
-- being interested in why we are here -- is not a " casual " interest like -- collecting stamps .
people who -- ask such questions are taking part in a debate that -- has gone on as long as man has lived on this planet .
how the universe , the earth , and life came into being is a bigger and more important question than who -- won the most gold medals in the last olympics .
the best way of -- approaching philosophy is -- to ask a few philosophical questions :
how was the world created -- ?
is there any will or meaning behind what -- happens ?
is there a life after death ?
how can we answer these questions -- ?
and most important , how ought we to live -- ?
people have been asking these questions throughout the ages .
we know of no culture which -- has not concerned itself with what man is -- and where the world came from -- .
basically there are not many philosophical questions -- -- to ask -- .
but history presents us with many different answers to each question .
so it -- is easier -- to ask philosophical questions than -- to answer them .
today as well each individual has -- to discover his own answer to these same questions .
you cannot find out whether there is a god or whether there is life after death by -- looking in an encyclopedia .
nor does the encyclopedia tell us how we ought -- to live -- .
however , -- reading what other people have believed -- can help us formulate our own view of life .
philosophers ' search for the truth resembles a detective story .
some think -- andersen was the murderer , others think -- it was nielsen or jensen .
the police are sometimes able -- to solve a real crime .
but it -- is equally possible that they never get to the bottom of it , although there is a solution somewhere .
so even if it -- is difficult -- to answer a question , there may be one -- and only one -- right answer .
either there is a kind of existence after death or there is not .
a lot of age-old enigmas have now been explained -- by science .
what the dark side of the moon looks like -- was once shrouded -- in mystery .
it was not the kind of thing that -- could be solved -- by discussion , it was left -- to the imagination of the individual .
but today we know exactly what the dark side of the moon looks like -- , and no one can " believe " any longer in the man in the moon , or that the moon is made -- of green cheese .
a greek philosopher who -- lived more than two thousand years ago believed that philosophy had its origin in man ’s sense of wonder .
man thought -- it -- was so astonishing -- to be alive that philosophical questions arose of their own accord .
it is like -- watching a magic trick .
we cannot understand how it is done -- -- .
a lot of people experience the world with the same incredulity as when a magician suddenly pulls a rabbit out of a hat which -- has just been shown -- to them empty -- .
in the case of the rabbit , we know -- the magician has tricked us .
what we would like -- to know -- is just how he did it -- .
but when it comes to the world -- it ’s somewhat different .
we know that the world is not all sleight of hand and deception because here we are in it , we are part of it .
actually , we are the white rabbit being pulled -- out of the hat .
the only difference between us and the white rabbit is that the rabbit does not realize -- it is taking part in a magic trick .
unlike us .
we feel -- we are part of something mysterious and we would like -- to know how it all works -- .
p.s.
as far as the white rabbit is concerned -- , it -- might be better -- to compare it with the whole universe .
but philosophers are always trying -- to climb up the fine hairs of the fur in order -- to stare right into the magician ’s eyes .
are you still there , sophie ?
to be continued ...
sophie was completely exhausted .
she could not even remember if she had taken the time -- to breathe while she read .
who -- had brought this letter ?
it could n’t be the same person who -- had sent the birthday card to hilde møller knag because that card had both a stamp and a postmark .
the brown envelope had been delivered -- by hand to the mailbox exactly like the two white ones .
sophie looked at her watch .
it was a quarter to three .
her mother would not be home from work for over two hours .
sophie crawled out into the garden again and ran to the mailbox .
perhaps there was another letter .
she found one more brown envelope with her name on it .
this time she looked all around but there was nobody in sight .
sophie ran to the edge of the woods and looked down the path .
no one was there .
suddenly she thought -- she heard a twig snap deep in the woods .
but she was not completely sure , and anyway it -- would be pointless -- to chase after someone who -- was determined -- to get away .
sophie let herself into the house .
she ran upstairs to her room and took out a big cookie tin full of pretty stones .
then she hurried out into the garden again , -- holding the tin securely with both hands .
before she went she put some food out for sherekan .
" kitty , kitty , kitty ! "
once back in the den she opened the second brown envelope and drew out the new typewritten pages .
a strange creature
hello again !
as you see , this short course in philosophy will come in handy-sized portions .
here are -- a few more introductory remarks :
did i say that the only thing -- we require -- to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder ?
if i did not , i say it now : the only thing -- we require -- to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder .
babies have this faculty .
that is not surprising .
after a few short months in the womb they slip out into a brand-new reality .
but as they grow up the faculty of wonder seems -- to diminish .
why is this -- ?
if a newborn baby could talk , it would probably say something about what an extraordinary world it had come into -- .
we see how it looks around and reaches out in curiosity to everything -- it sees -- .
as words are gradually acquired -- , the child looks up and says " bow-wow " every time it sees a dog .
it jumps up and down in its stroller , -- waving its arms " bow-wow ! bow-wow ! "
we who -- are older and wiser may feel somewhat exhausted by the child ’s enthusiasm .
" all right , all right , it ’s a bow-wow , " we say -- , -- unimpressed .
we are not enthralled .
we have seen a dog before .
this rapturous performance may repeat itself hundreds of times before the child learns -- to pass a dog without -- going crazy .
or an elephant , or a hippopotamus .
but long before the child learns -- to talk properly and long before it learns -- to think philosophically -- the world will have become a habit .
a pity , if you ask me .
my concern is that you do not grow up -- to be one of those people who -- take the world for granted , sophie dear .
so just -- to make sure , we are going -- to do a couple of experiments in thought before we begin on the course itself .
-- imagine that one day you are out for a walk in the woods .
suddenly you see a small spaceship on the path in front of you .
a tiny martian climbs out of the spaceship and stands on the ground -- looking up at you ...
what would you think -- ?
never mind , it ’s not important .
but have you ever given any thought to the fact that you are a martian yourself ?
it -- is obviously unlikely that you will ever stumble upon a creature from another planet .
we do not even know that there is life on other planets .
but you might stumble upon yourself one day .
you might suddenly stop short and see yourself in a completely new light .
on just such a walk in the woods .
i am an extraordinary being , you think -- .
i am a mysterious creature .
you feel as if you are waking from an enchanted slumber .
who -- am i ? you ask -- .
you know that you are stumbling around on a planet in the universe .
but what -- is the universe ?
if you discover yourself in this manner you will have discovered something as mysterious as the martian -- we just mentioned -- .
you will not only have seen a being from outer space .
do you follow me , sophie ?
-- let ’s do another experiment in thought :
one morning , mom , dad , and little thomas , aged -- two or three , are having breakfast in the kitchen .
after a while mom gets up and goes over to the kitchen sink , and dad -- yes , dad -- flies up and floats around under the ceiling while thomas sits -- watching .
what do you think -- thomas says -- ?
perhaps he points up at his father and says " daddy ’s flying ! "
thomas will certainly be astonished , but then he very often is .
dad does so many strange things that this business of a little flight over the breakfast table makes no difference to him .
every day dad shaves with a funny machine , sometimes he climbs onto the roof and turns the tv aerial or else he sticks his head under the hood of the car and comes up black in the face .
now it ’s mom ’s turn .
she hears what thomas says -- and turns around abruptly .
how do you think -- she reacts to the sight of dad floating nonchalantly over the kitchen table -- ?
she drops the jam jar on the floor and screams with fright .
she may even need medical attention once dad has returned respectably to his chair .
( he should have learned better table manners by now ! )
why do you think -- thomas and his mother react so differently -- ?
it all has -- to do with habit .
( -- note this ! )
mom has learned that people cannot fly .
thomas has not -- .
he still is n’t certain what you can and cannot do in this world -- .
but what about the world itself , sophie ?
do you think -- it can do what it does -- ?
the world is also floating in space .
sadly it is not only the force of gravity -- we get used to -- as we grow up .
the world itself becomes a habit in no time at all .
it seems as if in the process of growing up we lose the ability -- to wonder about the world .
and in -- doing so , we lose something central -- something -- philosophers try -- to restore .
for somewhere inside ourselves , something tells us that life is a huge mystery .
this is something -- we once experienced , long before we learned -- to think the thought .
-- to be more precise -- although philosophical questions concern us all , we do not all become philosophers .
for various reasons most people get so caught up in everyday affairs that their astonishment at the world gets pushed into the background .
( they crawl deep into the rabbit ’s fur , snuggle down comfortably , and stay there for the rest of their lives . )
to children , the world and everything in it is new , something that -- gives rise to astonishment -- .
it is not like that for adults .
most adults accept the world as a matter of course .
this is precisely where philosophers are a notable exception -- .
a philosopher never gets quite used to the world .
to him or her , the world continues -- to seem a bit unreasonable -- bewildering , even enigmatic -- .
philosophers and small children thus have an important faculty in common .
you might say that throughout his life a philosopher remains as thin-skinned as a child .
so now you must choose , sophie .
are you a child who -- has not yet become world-weary ?
or are you a philosopher who -- will vow -- never to become so ?
if you just shake your head , -- not recognizing yourself as either a child or a philosopher , then you have gotten so used to the world that it no longer astonishes you .
and this is why you are receiving this course in philosophy -- , just in case .
i will not allow you , of all people , to join the ranks of the apathetic and the indifferent .
i want you to have an inquiring mind .
the whole course is free of charge , so you get no money back if you do not complete it .
if you choose -- to break off the course you are free -- to do so .
a live frog would be eminently suitable .
something green , at least , otherwise the mailman might get scared -- .
-- to summarize briefly : a white rabbit is pulled out -- of a top hat .
because it is an extremely large rabbit , the trick takes many billions of years .
all mortals are born -- at the very tip of the rabbit ’s fine hairs , where they are in a position -- to wonder at the impossibility of the trick -- .
but as they grow older they work themselves ever deeper into the fur .
and there they stay .
they become so comfortable -- they never risk -- crawling back up the fragile hairs again .
only philosophers embark on this perilous expedition to the outermost reaches of language and existence .
some of them fall off , but others cling on desperately and yell at the people nestling deep in the snug softness , stuffing themselves with delicious food and drink .
" ladies and gentlemen , " they yell -- , " we are floating in space ! "
but none of the people down there care .
" what a bunch of troublemakers ! " they say -- .
and they keep on -- chatting : would you pass the butter , please ?
how much have our stocks risen today -- ?
what is the price of tomatoes -- ?
have you heard that princess di is expecting again ?
when sophie ’s mother got home later that afternoon -- , sophie was practically in shock .
the tin containing the letters from the mysterious philosopher was safely hidden -- in the den .
sophie had tried -- to start her homework but could only sit -- thinking about what she had read -- .
she had never thought so hard before !
she was no longer a child but she was n’t really grown up either .
sophie realized that she had already begun -- to crawl down into the cozy rabbit ’s fur , the very same rabbit that -- had been pulled -- from the top hat of the universe .
but the philosopher had stopped her .
he -- or was it a she ? -- had grabbed her by the back of the neck and pulled her up again to the tip of the fur where she had played as a child -- .
and there , on the outermost tips of the fine hairs , she was once again seeing the world as if for the very first time .
the philosopher had rescued her .
no doubt about it .
the unknown letter writer had saved her from the triviality of everyday existence .
when mom got home at five o’clock -- , sophie dragged her into the living room and pushed her into an armchair .
" mom -- do n’t you think -- it -- ’s astonishing -- to be alive ? " she began --
her mother was so surprised that she did n’t answer at first .
sophie was usually doing her homework when she got home -- .
" i suppose -- i do sometimes , " she said -- .
" sometimes ?
yes , but do n’t you think -- it -- ’s astonishing that the world exists at all ? "
" -- now look , sophie .
-- stop -- talking like that . "
" why ?
perhaps you think -- the world is quite normal ? "
" well , is n’t it -- ?
more or less , anyway . "
sophie saw that the philosopher was right .
grownups took the world for -- granted -- .
they had let themselves be lulled -- into the enchanted sleep of their humdrum existence once and for all .
" you ’ve just grown so used to the world that nothing surprises you any more . "
" what on earth are you talking about -- ? "
" i ’m talking about you getting so used to everything .
totally dim , in other words . "
" i will not be spoken to -- like that , sophie ! "
" all right , i ’ll put it another way .
you ’ve made yourself comfortable deep down in the fur of a white rabbit that -- is being pulled out -- of the universe ’s top hat right now .
and in a minute you ’ll put the potatoes on .
then you ’ll read the paper and after half an hour ’s nap you ’ll watch the news on tv ! "
an anxious expression came over her mother ’s face .
she did indeed go into the kitchen and put the potatoes on .
after a while she came back into the living room , and this time it was she who -- pushed sophie into an armchair .
" there ’s something -- i must talk to you about -- , " she began -- .
sophie could tell by her voice that it was something serious .
" you have n’t gotten yourself mixed up with drugs , have you -- , dear ? "
sophie was just about -- to laugh , but she understood why the question was being brought up -- now -- .
" are you nuts ? " she said -- .
" that only makes you duller ! "
no more was said -- that evening about either drugs or white rabbits .
