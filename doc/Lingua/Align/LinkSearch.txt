NAME
    Lingua::Align::LinkSearch - Search algorithms for tree alignment

SYNOPSIS
        my $aligner = new Lingua::Align::LinkSearch(-link_search => $type);
        $aligner->search(\%links,\@scores,$min_score,\@src,\@trg)

DESCRIPTION
    Class factory for searching the best tree alignment based on local link
    scores Various strategies have been implemented. Use the argument
    "-link_search" in the constructor to choose from the following search
    strategies:

     threshold .............. greedy search with score thresholds
     assignment ............. bipartite graph matching (assignment problem)
     greedy ................. greedy search
     greedyWellformed ....... greedy search with well-formedness constraints
     greedyFinal ............ add step to link unlinked nodes (if wellformed)
     greedyFinalAnd ......... add step to link still unlinked nodes
     src2trg ................ source-to-target alignment (one link / source)
     trg2src ................ target-to-source alignment (one link / target)
     src2trgWellFormed ...... src2trg with wellformedness constraints
     intersection ........... intersection between src2trg and trg2src
     NTfirst ................ align non-terminals nodes first
     NTonly ................. align only non-terminals
     Tonly .................. align only termnal nodes
     PaCoMT ................. used in PaCoMT project
     cascaded ............... conbine search strategies (sequentially)
