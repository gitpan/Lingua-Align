NAME
    convert_treebank - convert a treebank from one format to another

SYNOPSIS
        treealign [-i] infile informat outformat > outfile

DESCRIPTION
    This script allows you to convert a treebank to another format. The
    converted treebank is printed to STDOUT. Currently the following formats
    are supported:

    AlpinoXML (alpino)
        The XML format used by the Dutch dependency parser Alpino. Use the
        option [-i] to skip index nodes from that format.

    PennTreebank (penn)
        The bracketing format from the Penn Treebank. Sentences should be
        separated by empty lines. This can be used to read, for example, the
        output of the Berkeley Parser.

    Stanford Parser format (stanford)
        This is essentially the same as the PennTreebank format but includes
        also the depedency relations that can optionally be produced by the
        Stanford parser. The conversion script tries to attach the relations
        to the phrase-structure trees. (This is rather experimental and the
        labeling might be different from what you'd expect -- use with
        care!).

    TigerXML (tiger)
        This is the TigerXML format which is used as a standard in the
        TreeAligner (mainly because it is also used in the Stockholm Tree
        Aligner which allows to visualize and edit the automatic tree
        alignments).
